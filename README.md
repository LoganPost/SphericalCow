# SphericalCow
Avoid the farm animals bouncing off each other and the walls and collect the candy
##Description
Initially, this game was a fun physics simulation of elastic collisions between circles of varying mass and sizes. Then, I noticed that it was fun to move my cursor around, avoiding the bouncing balls. Thus, I added a circle following the cursor, candies to collect, and drawings of spherical farm animals.
